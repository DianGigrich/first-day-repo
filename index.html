      <p>Hello! I am 36 years old.  I have one human child, four fur children, and eight feathered children.  I have been home-making for two years and am starting up my career.
        I enjoy anime and video games.  Some of my favorites are Final Fantasy, Genshin Impact, and League of Legends.  I have many hobbies, but primarily I like projects that fix and improve things.  I play board games every week.  We have started Gloomhaven, but we've played all types of games from Werewords to Eldritch Horror.  That's why I think I'll be a good coder.
      </p>
